You will play the role of a doctor responsible for managing blood donors and patients in need of blood. Your tasks include selecting a blood bag, extracting blood from donors, storing it in blood storage units, and ensuring the appropriate blood type is chosen for each patient.

Control : Use the arrow keys (up, left, right) to move, Press the Spacebar to pick up.

(This is my little project.)
